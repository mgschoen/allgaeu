Green hills, mountains, wooden huts, cows - things Germans usually associate with an alpine region called Allgäu ("Ull-goy"). But in fact these things exist everywhere in the world. Or is it half the world copying this magnificiently beautiful area (which happens to be my home region)?
So here's the test: Can you separate the wheat from the chaff? Are these pictures from Allgäu - or not?
